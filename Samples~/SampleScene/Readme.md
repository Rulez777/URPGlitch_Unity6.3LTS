there is a 2d renderer in this folder, please add it to your urp asset to make the sample work. the camera in the sample scene refers to this renderer to work, if you dont want to do it then swap the camera's renderer to yours or add the render features(analog and digital) to your own 2d renderer/ other renderer asset. this sample is for 2d. thank you.
